# String Anagrams
In this assignment, you'll design and implement a method that checks if the two input strings are anagrams of each other.
Remember that a string is an array of characters. Algorithms that worked on an array data structure will work on strings as well.

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method to check if the two input parameter strings are anagrams of each other. 
  The method should return `true` if the two input parameters are anagrams of each other. Otherwise, return `false`.
* Above the method, elaborate the comment to share the time and space complexity of your method.
    * Your solution should optimize the space complexity as much as possible. In other words, do not use any more space than needed.
    * If you think of more than one approach, explain the other alternatives you thought of, their space and time complexity and your reasoning for choosing the algorithm you choose.
    * If you explain the complexity in terms of *n*, be sure to explain what *n* stands for.

* Anagrams: Two strings are anagrams if you can rearrange the characters in one string to create the other string. e.g. "iceman" and "cinema".

* <b>Notes</b>: 
    * Do not use Ruby provided functionality for `.reverse` and `.reverse!`.
    * You may use `.length` method available in the String class.
    * You may access a character at a given index or set the value at a given index.
